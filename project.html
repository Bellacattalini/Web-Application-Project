The Scrunch Top is a contemporary maternity garment designed to evolve with the body from pregnancy to postpartum. Created for women who value design as much as comfort, it blends functional support with a bold fashion aesthetic, empowering wearers to express themselves confidently during a transformative life stage.</p>

                                        <h3>TECH209: Quilt Project</h3>
                                        <p>The Quilt Project for TECH209 involved creating two distinct quilts that explored both personal expression and collective creativity. The Petit Art Quilt was inspired by the fusion of Victorian elegance with punk and gothic rebellion, drawing influence from Andi Shorts’ Bye Bambi fashion brand. Crafted from hand-dyed and printed fabrics, the quilt combined bold contrasts of pink and black to symbolise femininity, individuality, and defiance of social norms. Features such as dramatic frills, hand-illustrated motifs, and rag quilt construction echoed Victorian styling while reflecting punk influences, resulting in a piece that embodied self-expression, authenticity, and timeless style.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The second, the Community Petite Quilt, was a collaborative project inspired by the natural beauty of a beach sunset. Through carefully selected dyeing techniques—including crackle wax, shibori, and salt resist—the quilt captured the colours, textures, and reflective qualities of dusk over the ocean. With its symmetrical layout and organic design, the quilt conveyed harmony and peacefulness, serving as both a tribute to nature’s beauty and an expression of shared creativity. Together, these quilts highlight the fusion of historical influence, personal voice, and collective artistry in contemporary textile practice.</p>

                                        <h3>HSC Textiles Major Project</h3>
                                        <p>The Year 12 Textiles Major Project was a ball gown inspired by Vincent van Gogh’s Starry Night, showcasing advanced skills in design, construction, and innovation. The gown highlighted my abilities in patternmaking, embroidery, and fabric manipulation, while also incorporating technology through the use of LED lights, conductive thread, and a battery pack to replicate the stars of the night sky. Design elements drew on the painting’s curved lines, reflected in the intricate pleating wrapped around the sleeves, and an asymmetrical bodice that added movement and drama. This project not only demonstrated technical expertise but also my ability to merge art, fashion, and technology into a cohesive and visually striking piece.</p>

                                        <h3>TECH107: Timber Lamp Project</h3>
                                        <p>The Timber Lamp Project was designed to address the gap between high-end, expensive designer lamps and cheap, low-quality alternatives. Research showed that stylish lamps often cost $300–$400, while mass-produced versions sold for around $20 lacked durability and design value. My lamp aims to provide a middle ground—an affordable yet well-crafted piece that is both functional and timeless in style. Targeted towards working professionals aged 25 and above, the design offers not only practical lighting but also enhances the ambience and aesthetic of any space.</p>
                                        <p>Lamp uses MDF timber which has been laser cut, stained and glued together to create a functional and aesthetic design at a lower price point.</p>

                                        <h3>TECH107: Phone Safe Box Project for High School Students</h3>
                                        <p>The Phone Safe Box Project was CAD designed, rendered, and then produced as an example of an achievable yet engaging project for Year 7–8 students in the Technology Mandatory curriculum. The design provides a secure and practical storage solution for mobile phones, keeping them safe from damage while also encouraging focused learning during class. By combining simple timber construction with functional design, the project demonstrates how students can develop core woodworking and design skills while producing a relevant, real-world product.</p>

                                        <h3>TECH211: Electromechanical Technologies - Automatic Bubblegum Dispensor Machine</h3>
                                        <p>The Bubble Gum Machine Project combined electronics and design to create an interactive dispenser. Using an IR sensor to detect hand movement and a servo motor to control the dispenser door, the machine released a single gumball at a time. The dispenser door was key in providing accuracy and control—preventing multiple gumballs from being released at once and ensuring only one dropped into the user’s hand. The sensor was positioned on the side of the machine for reliable detection, triggering the servo to “flick” the gumball out. This project highlighted the importance of precision in both design and programming to achieve a functional outcome.</p>
